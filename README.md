# Welcome to the unnoficial minecraft server automatic installer for windows
I added the next server softwares:
- Purpur
- Paper
- Spigot
- CraftBukkit
# How to install
You first need to install python. Then you need to open the "Command Prompt" and type: "python main.py" in the directory where you downloaded the app in.
# How to use
After you opened the app, you can change settings and select your server software. You will have to select between two (only one implemented) settings and then change them (if needed). After that you can select your server software and you are set to go!
# How to start the server (Only if the setting for it was set to "Yes")
You need to double-click on the newly created "server.bat" file. It will automatically start the minecraft server.
# How to accept the EULA
Open the file "eula.txt" then change the false from "eula=false" to true.
